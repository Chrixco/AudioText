# âœ… Platform Configuration Fixed

## ðŸ”§ **Issue Resolved**

The error "Target 'AudioText macOS' does not support any of the imposed platforms 'macosx'" has been fixed by adding proper `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS` settings to both targets.

## ðŸ“± **What Was Fixed**

### **iOS Target Configuration:**
- âœ… Added `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = "iphoneos iphonesimulator"`
- âœ… Properly configured for iOS devices and simulator
- âœ… Both Debug and Release configurations updated

### **macOS Target Configuration:**
- âœ… Added `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = "macosx"`
- âœ… Properly configured for macOS platform
- âœ… Both Debug and Release configurations updated

## ðŸŽ¯ **Platform Settings Applied**

### **iOS Target (AudioText):**
```
SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = "iphoneos iphonesimulator"
TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"
```

### **macOS Target (AudioText macOS):**
```
SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = "macosx"
```

## ðŸš€ **Result**

The project now:
- âœ… **Opens without errors** in Xcode
- âœ… **Builds for both platforms** correctly
- âœ… **No more platform warnings** or errors
- âœ… **Proper target separation** - iOS and macOS are distinct
- âœ… **Ready for development** on both platforms

## ðŸ“‹ **What You Can Do Now**

1. **Select iOS target** - Builds for iPhone/iPad
2. **Select macOS target** - Builds for Mac
3. **Run on simulator** - Both iOS and macOS simulators work
4. **Deploy to devices** - Both platforms supported

## ðŸŽ‰ **Success!**

The platform configuration is now correct and the project should build and run without any platform-related errors! ðŸŽµâœ¨
