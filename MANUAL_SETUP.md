# Manual Setup Guide for AudioText Project

## âœ… **Project Now Opens Successfully!**

The basic project structure is now working. You'll need to add the additional Swift files manually in Xcode.

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Setup**

### 1. **Open the Project**
The project should now open in Xcode without the "Failed to load container" error.

### 2. **Add Swift Files to Project**

#### A. Add Design Files
1. Right-click on "AudioText" in the project navigator
2. Select "New Group" â†’ Name it "Design"
3. Right-click on "Design" â†’ "Add Files to 'AudioText'"
4. Navigate to and select:
   - `AudioText/Design/NeumorphicColors.swift`
   - `AudioText/Design/NeumorphicButton.swift`
5. Make sure "AudioText" target is checked
6. Click "Add"

#### B. Add ViewModels
1. Right-click on "AudioText" â†’ "New Group" â†’ Name it "ViewModels"
2. Add `AudioText/ViewModels/AudioTextViewModel.swift`

#### C. Add Services
1. Right-click on "AudioText" â†’ "New Group" â†’ Name it "Services"
2. Add:
   - `AudioText/Services/AudioRecorder.swift`
   - `AudioText/Services/WhisperService.swift`

#### D. Add Models
1. Right-click on "AudioText" â†’ "New Group" â†’ Name it "Models"
2. Add `AudioText/Models/TranscriptionResult.swift`

### 3. **Add Files to macOS Target**
For each Swift file you added:
1. Select the file in the project navigator
2. In the File Inspector (right panel), check "AudioText macOS" target
3. This ensures the files are included in both iOS and macOS builds

### 4. **Set API Key**
1. Edit Scheme â†’ Run â†’ Arguments â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key value

### 5. **Build and Test**
1. Select "AudioText" scheme for iOS
2. Press Cmd+B to build
3. Press Cmd+R to run

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Result**

After adding all files, you should have:
- âœ… No build errors
- âœ… All Swift files visible in project navigator
- âœ… AudioTextViewModel and other classes in scope
- âœ… Working neumorphic UI
- âœ… Functional audio recording and transcription

## ðŸš¨ **If You Still Get Errors**

### Import Errors
- Make sure all Swift files are added to both targets
- Clean build folder: Cmd+Shift+K
- Rebuild: Cmd+B

### Missing Classes
- Verify files are added to the project
- Check target membership in File Inspector
- Ensure files are in the correct groups

## ðŸŽ‰ **Success!**

Once all files are added, you'll have a fully functional AudioText app with:
- Beautiful neumorphic design
- AI-powered transcription
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Professional code structure

The project is now ready for development! ðŸŽµâœ¨
