# Add Remaining Neumorphic Components

## Files Still Need to Be Added to Xcode Project

You've already added some files, but these 6 neumorphic component files are still missing from the Xcode project:

1. ✅ `AudioText/Components/NeumorphicAudioVisualizer.swift`
2. ✅ `AudioText/Components/NeumorphicInputModeSelector.swift`
3. ✅ `AudioText/Components/NeumorphicLanguageSelector.swift`
4. ✅ `AudioText/Components/NeumorphicLibraryButton.swift`
5. ✅ `AudioText/Components/NeumorphicRecordingButton.swift`
6. ✅ `AudioText/Components/NeumorphicStatusBanner.swift`

## Quick Steps (Same as Before)

1. **In Xcode**: File → Add Files to "AudioText"...

2. **Navigate to**: `/Users/chcorral/Documents/GITHUB/AudioText/AudioText/Components/`

3. **Select these 6 files** (hold ⌘ Cmd to multi-select):
   - NeumorphicAudioVisualizer.swift
   - NeumorphicInputModeSelector.swift
   - NeumorphicLanguageSelector.swift
   - NeumorphicLibraryButton.swift
   - NeumorphicRecordingButton.swift
   - NeumorphicStatusBanner.swift

4. **Settings**:
   - ☐ UNCHECK "Copy items if needed"
   - ☑ CHECK "AudioText" target
   - ☑ CHECK "AudioText macOS" target

5. **Click "Add"**

6. **Build**: Press ⌘B

## Note About Duplicate Files

You may see duplicate files in the root `AudioText/` folder and `Components/` folder. The Xcode project should reference the ones in `Components/`. After adding these files, you can delete the duplicates if you want to clean up.

## After Adding

Once you add these 6 components, the build should succeed! You'll have:
- ✅ Complete neumorphic UI
- ✅ Working Player tab with rotary play button
- ✅ All 4 tabs functional (Record, Library, Player, Settings)
