# Quick Fix for "Cannot find AudioTextViewModel" Error

## ðŸš¨ **The Problem**
The error occurs because `AudioTextViewModel` class exists in the file system but isn't included in the Xcode project.

## âš¡ **Quick Solution**

### Step 1: Add ViewModels Group
1. Open `AudioText.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Right-click on "AudioText" in project navigator
3. Select "New Group" â†’ Name it "ViewModels"
4. Right-click on "ViewModels" â†’ "Add Files to 'AudioText'"
5. Navigate to `AudioText/ViewModels/AudioTextViewModel.swift`
6. Select the file and click "Add"
7. Make sure "AudioText" target is checked

### Step 2: Add Other Required Files
Repeat the process for:

**Design Group:**
- `AudioText/Design/NeumorphicColors.swift`
- `AudioText/Design/NeumorphicButton.swift`

**Services Group:**
- `AudioText/Services/AudioRecorder.swift`
- `AudioText/Services/WhisperService.swift`

**Models Group:**
- `AudioText/Models/TranscriptionResult.swift`

### Step 3: Add to macOS Target
For each file you added:
1. Select the file in project navigator
2. In File Inspector (right panel), check "AudioText macOS" target

### Step 4: Build
1. Clean build folder: `Cmd+Shift+K`
2. Build: `Cmd+B`

## âœ… **Result**
- No more "Cannot find AudioTextViewModel" error
- All classes will be in scope
- Project builds successfully
- Both iOS and macOS targets work

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Happens**
The project file only includes the basic files (AudioTextApp.swift, ContentView.swift). The additional Swift files need to be manually added to make them part of the build process.

This is a one-time setup - once added, the files will always be included in the project! ðŸŽ‰
