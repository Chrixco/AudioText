echo "üöÄ SOLUTION: Add Files to Xcode Project"
echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "üìã MANUAL STEPS:"
echo "================"
echo ""
echo "1. Open AudioText.xcodeproj in Xcode"
echo ""
echo "2. In Project Navigator (left sidebar):"
echo "   - Right-click on 'AudioText' folder (blue icon)"
echo "   - Select 'Add Files to AudioText'"
echo ""
echo "3. Select these backend files:"
for file in "${FILES[@]}"; do
    echo "   - $file"
done
echo ""
echo "4. In the dialog that appears:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Check 'AudioText' target (iOS)"
echo "   ‚úÖ Check 'AudioText macOS' target (macOS)"
echo "   ‚úÖ Check 'Copy items if needed'"
echo "   - Click 'Add'"
echo ""
echo "5. Clean and Build:"
echo "   - Clean Build Folder: Cmd+Shift+K"
echo "   - Build Project: Cmd+B"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ This will fix ALL 'Cannot find type in scope' errors!"
echo ""
echo "üéØ EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "=================="
echo "After adding files:"
echo "‚úÖ AudioRecorder type will be found"
echo "‚úÖ AudioPlayer type will be found"
echo "‚úÖ RecordingFile type will be found"
echo "‚úÖ All scope errors will disappear"
echo "‚úÖ Backend functionality will work"
echo ""
echo "üì± The app will have complete backend functionality!"
echo ""
echo "üîç WHY THIS WORKS:"
echo "=================="
echo "Adding files to Xcode project makes them available to the compiler,"
echo "resolving all scope errors and enabling full backend functionality!"
